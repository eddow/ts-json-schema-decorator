# ts-json-schema-decorator
Generate JSON-Schemas out of typescript classes thanks to decorators

## Limitations

Properties need to have at least one decorator for their type to be accessible by reflection => why not @Require(false)?

# Note

This is code taken from another project - it is bare code without its own environement (test/...)
Is anyone in a mood to make it "work at first try"?
